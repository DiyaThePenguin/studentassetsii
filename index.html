      <p>Environmental pollution is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting the health and wellbeing of millions of people and animals around the world. However, not everyone agrees on the causes, effects, and solutions of this problem. That is why a group of middle school students from Glacier Middle School in Buckley, Washington decided to participate in a debate competition on this topic, hoping to raise awareness and persuade others to take action. The students prepared for the debate by researching various sources of information, sucn as books, articles, websites, and documentaries. They learned about the different types of pollution, such as air, water, soil, and noise pollution, and how they impact the environment and human health. They also studied the main causes of pollution, such as industrial activities, transportation, agriculture, and waste disposal. They also explored the possible solutions to reduce pollution, such as using renewable energy sources, recycling, conserving water, planting trees, and adopting eco-friendly habits. The students faced a tough opponent in the debate, a team from another middle school that argued that environmental pollution is not a serious issue and that the solutions are too costly and impractical. The students used their knowledge and skills to counter their arguments with facts and evidence. They showed how pollution affects not only the environment but also the economy and society. They demonstrated how the solutions are not only feasible but also beneficial for everyone in the long run. They also appealed to the emotions and and values of the audience by using stories, examples, and statistics. The students won the debate by convincing the judges and the audience that environmental pollution is a real and urgent problem that requires immediate attention from everyone. They received a trophy and a certificate for their achievement. They also recieved praise and recognition from their teachers, parents, and peers. They felt proud and happy for their success. They also felt motivated and inspired to continue learning and spreading awareness about environmental issues. They hoped that their debate would make a difference in the world.</p>

      <p>A middle school from Buckley, Washington participated in an inter-school science fair project competition that challenged students to create innovative solutions for real-world problems. The team chose to work on a project that aimed to reduce plastice waste and pollution by converting plastic bottles into eco-bricks. The team collected plastic bottles from their homes, schools, and communities and cut them into small pieces. They then used a machine that they built themselves to melt the plastic pieces and mold them into bricks. They tested the strength, durability, and insulation of the bricks and compared them with conventional bricks. They also calculated the cost, energy, and environmental impact of their process. The team presented their project at the science fair, where they impressed the judges and the audience with their creativity, skills, and knowledge. They explained how their project could help solve the problem of plastic waste and pollution by transforming it into a useful and sustainable material. They also demonstrated how their bricks could be used to build houses, schools, and other structures in low-income areas. The team won second place in the competition, which was a great achievement. They recieved a medal and a certificate for their work. They also recieved praise and recognition from their teachers, parents, and peers. </p>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organized and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutrionitonal choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> 1. Accuracy 
    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data. 
<br>
2. Economics
Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting and end to inaccurate time reportiing, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems. 
<br>
3. Productivity/Effiency
Monitoring and mangaing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits. Meanwhile, this has real-time tracking, security, and compliance.
